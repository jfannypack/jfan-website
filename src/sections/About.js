    <SectionHeading>About Me</SectionHeading>
    <p>
      I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate Student at Boston College. I am
      currently taking courses in <em>Algorithms</em> as well as exploring the{" "}
      <em>design and construction of Database Systems</em>. In my free time, I
      love playing tenor saxophone with the Boston College Jazz Band, and I also
      enjoy working on personal projects such as this one!
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Computer Science student, I recognize that the ability to learn
      effectively is crucial. My approach goes beyond just grasping the basics;
      I delve deeply into each aspect of a subject, methodically piecing
      together a comprehensive understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my previous roles, I've honed my ability to thrive in team
      environments. I prioritize writing code that is not only clean and
      efficient but also thoroughly tested and meticulously documented, ensuring
      ease of use for my colleagues. Understanding and addressing the needs of
      my peers has been a key component of my collaborative success.
    </p>
    <p>
      My commitment to excellence is underscored by a solid work ethic. I will
      always work as hard as I can to produce the most complete, polished
      product as a developer.
